# Warning

**If you are not me, you SHOULD NOT install directly from this repository**

I will often completely break this repository while making changes. Which means that at any point this may completely
trash your command line, stop your system from booting *(it happened once)*, or worse. This is only tested on the few
systems that I run, and will probably not entirely work on other systems

After reading that warning, and you still want to give these dotfiles a try, first fork this repository, review the
code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails.

## Installation

**Warning**

---
You may see warnings such as: "existing target is neither a link nor a directory: .bashrc". In those cases you will
need to manually delete those files first.
