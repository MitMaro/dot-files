# Warning

**If you are not me, you SHOULD NOT install directly from this repository**

I will often completely break this repository while making changes. Which means that at any point this may completely trash your
command line, stop your system from booting *(it happened once)*, or worse. This is only tested on the few systems that I run,
and will probably not entirely work on other systems

After reading that warning, and you still want to give these dotfiles a try, first fork this repository, review the code, and
remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails.

## Installation

**Read Warning Above**
